### Summary

 * Between the 3 fares we see that they are all fairly consistent. The 3 recommentdations would be to firstly go with Urban areas as the amount of rides are  much more, they maybe be shorter and cost less but are much more frequent and make more money in total. 

 * There are usually less drivers in the rural areas which means the cost of the fare goes up, also because the distance that needs to be traveled. But if there were a few more drivers in Rural areas you can capitlaize on the higher fare and increase the chance of someone using the service if they see there are more drivers available for pick up.

 * Lastly, If there could be a slight increase in the amount the driver can make the further the drive, i believe that would make more drivers want to go suburban and rural. Most stay away because the rides are obviously less frequent and ther eis more money to be made in urban areas. But if you give the drivers and added incenetive the hover in the further areas, more drivers would probably do so and increase the chances of somneone ordering a ride if they see more drivers available
